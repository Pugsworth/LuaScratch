ScratchPad
==========

ScratchPad is a plugin that allows you to use whatever build system is currently assiciated with the syntax to run either the selected text or an entire unsaved file.
This allows you to "Scratchpad" your code without needing to save it. This is useful for interpreted langauges if you want to test something or verify a piece of your code.
